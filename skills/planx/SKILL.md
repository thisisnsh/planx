description: >-
  Plan a feature, refactor or migration as a reviewable, versioned artifact the
  user annotates line by line before any code is written, instead of a plan that
  scrolls away in chat. Also revises or executes a plan they already have, or
  answers a question about how PlanX itself works from its wiki. Requires the
  planx CLI (`npm install --global @thisisnsh/planx`). Use for /planx, when the
  user wants to plan work or review and approve a plan before building, and for
  anything mentioning planx.

# planx

Turn a plan into an artifact the user reviews line by line, then build what
they settled on.

## Pick the branch

Match on what followed `/planx`:

| the user said | do this |
| --- | --- |
| `/planx` alone | say you are ready, and ask what to plan |
| `/planx revise <id>` | read `references/revise.md` |
| `/planx execute <id>` | read `references/execute.md` |
| `/planx help <question>` | read `references/help.md` |
| `/planx <anything else>` | read `references/plan.md` |

Read only the file for the branch you took.

`help` is a question about PlanX itself — a key, a command, where something is
stored. `/planx help me split the auth module` is a task with the word help in
it, and takes the plan branch. Ask when a line reads both ways.

**A version in the invocation travels with it.** `revise` and `execute` both
arrive as `<id> v<n>` — the version the user reviewed. Every planx command you
run on that branch names it. Nothing on any branch defaults to latest, because
latest can move between the review and the command.

Bare `/planx` does not print a menu of the branches. The `argument-hint` in the
front matter already showed them, in the slash menu, before enter was pressed —
repeating them after is a wall of text in answer to someone who is ready to
talk about their task.

If `planx` is not installed, do not fall back to writing the plan into chat —
the user asked for something they can annotate. Say the CLI is missing, and
offer to install it: `npm install --global @thisisnsh/planx`. Run it if they
agree, check that `planx --version` answers, and carry on with the branch you
were on. If they decline, or the install fails, stop and leave them the command.

## True on every branch

These three hold whichever file you read next, so they are here rather than in
one of them. Each guards a mistake that is live while planning, while revising
and while executing alike.

**Never edit files under `~/.planx` yourself.** Every change goes through the
CLI. `index.json` is a cache that the list and the picker read instead of
opening every plan, so a file changed behind it leaves the two disagreeing about
what is stored, and nothing but `planx doctor` will ever put that right.

**One capture per revision.** Capturing content identical to the current latest
is a safe no-op that hands back the existing version, so you may call it
defensively — but two captures of two different texts are two versions, and the
user now has a review round to spend working out which one they are reading.

**A follow-up message is one of three things.** Once a plan is captured, decide
which it is, and ask when it is not obvious:

- **a change to the plan on the table** → revise and capture a new version
- **a different piece of work** → ask whether to start a new plan
- **an instruction to build it** → ask whether to execute the plan as it stands

Never silently start a second plan, and never silently start implementing.
